    "- I participated in the Arlington 2050 project, which is a project created by Arlington County in Virginia, to obtain information from residents about Arlington's future. The county set up different polling stands where residents were given a post card and asked to answer a couple questions. \n",
    "- The questions were, \"Share your message from the future here!\", \"Getting here wasn't easy, but it was worth it! Here is how we did it:\"\n",
    "- The part I played in this whole project was analyising all the data, and creating visuals with it.\n",
    "- I specifically worked on the data collected from the county fair."
